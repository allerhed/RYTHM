# Training Load & Perceived Exertion Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented training load and perceived exertion fields for the RYTHM workout application, as requested from the workout description and perceived exertion inspiration images.

## Database Changes

### Migration: 004_add_training_load_and_perceived_exertion.sql
- Added `training_load` field to sessions table (INTEGER, nullable)
- Added `perceived_exertion` field to sessions table (DECIMAL(3,1), range 1.0-10.0)
- Applied appropriate constraints and documentation comments

## API Changes

### Updated Endpoints
1. **POST /api/sessions** - Create workout session
   - Now accepts `training_load` and `perceived_exertion` parameters
   - Validates and stores new fields in database
   - Returns new fields in response

2. **GET /api/sessions** - Retrieve workout sessions
   - Now includes `training_load` and `perceived_exertion` in response
   - Updated SQL query to include new fields
   - Maintains backward compatibility

## Frontend Changes

### New Workout Form (/training/new)
1. **Training Load Field**
   - Added numeric input field after workout info card
   - Optional field with placeholder and help text
   - Validates as integer value

2. **Perceived Exertion Slider**
   - Interactive 1-10 scale slider matching inspiration design
   - Dynamic labels from "Very, Very Easy" to "Max Effort"
   - Visual feedback with lime green gradient
   - Real-time display of current value and label
   - Custom CSS styling for cross-browser compatibility

3. **Form Submission**
   - Updated to include new fields in API request
   - Maintains existing validation and error handling

### Dashboard Updates (/dashboard)
1. **Workout Cards**
   - Now display actual training load when available
   - Show RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) value
   - Falls back to calculated load for older workouts
   - Added 4-column stats grid to accommodate new data

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [trainingLoad, setTrainingLoad] = useState<number | null>(null)
const [perceivedExertion, setPerceivedExertion] = useState<number>(4)
```

### Perceived Exertion Labels
```typescript
const PERCEIVED_EXERTION_LABELS = [
  { value: 1, label: 'Very, Very Easy' },
  { value: 2, label: 'Easy' },
  { value: 3, label: 'Moderate' },
  { value: 4, label: 'Somewhat Hard' },
  { value: 5, label: 'Hard' },
  { value: 6, label: 'Harder' },
  { value: 7, label: 'Very Hard' },
  { value: 8, label: 'Extremely Hard' },
  { value: 9, label: 'Close to Max Effort' },
  { value: 10, label: 'Max Effort' }
]
```

### Custom Slider Styling
- Cross-browser compatible range input styling
- Lime green theme matching app design
- Custom thumb and track styling
- Focus states for accessibility

## Testing

### Automated Test Script
Created `test-new-fields.sh` for comprehensive testing:
- ✅ Authentication flow
- ✅ Workout creation with new fields
- ✅ Database persistence verification
- ✅ API retrieval confirmation

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. Create workout with training load and perceived exertion
2. Create workout with only one new field
3. View workouts on dashboard with new data
4. Verify backward compatibility with existing workouts

## User Experience Improvements

### Form Flow
1. **Workout Info Card**: Name, type, date, duration
2. **Training Load Field**: Optional numeric input with guidance
3. **Perceived Exertion Slider**: Interactive 1-10 scale with real-time feedback
4. **Exercises Section**: Existing functionality maintained
5. **Notes**: Final workout notes

### Visual Design
- Maintains consistent design language
- Responsive layout for mobile devices
- Accessibility considerations (focus states, labels)
- Smooth interactions and visual feedback

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Database migration applied
- ✅ API server updated and tested
- ✅ Frontend components implemented
- ✅ All endpoints functional
- ✅ Cross-browser compatible

## Future Enhancements
1. Analytics dashboard for training load trends
2. RPE-based workout recommendations
3. Training load periodization features
4. Historical data visualization
5. Export functionality for training data

## Files Modified
- `packages/db/migrations/004_add_training_load_and_perceived_exertion.sql` (NEW)
- `apps/api/src/simple-server.js` (API endpoints)
- `apps/mobile/src/app/training/new/page.tsx` (Workout form)
- `apps/mobile/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (Workout display)
- `apps/mobile/src/app/globals.css` (Slider styling)
- `test-new-fields.sh` (NEW - Test script)

The implementation successfully matches the design inspiration while maintaining the existing application architecture and user experience.
