# Registration Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
The registration form was submitting but returning to itself without creating an account. The error in the terminal showed that tRPC was receiving `undefined` values for all required fields.

## Root Cause
The issue was with the tRPC HTTP request format. When making direct HTTP calls to tRPC endpoints, the data needs to be in a specific format that wasn't working correctly.

## Solution Implemented
I created direct Express endpoints that bypass tRPC for authentication operations:

### New Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Direct registration endpoint
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Direct login endpoint

### Changes Made
1. **API Server** (`apps/api/src/index.ts`):
   - Added direct auth endpoints
   - Imported bcrypt, jwt, and db at the top level
   - Implemented proper error handling and validation

2. **AuthContext** (`apps/mobile/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`):
   - Updated to use direct endpoints instead of tRPC
   - Simplified request format (no `json` wrapper needed)
   - Maintained all debugging and error handling

## How to Test
1. Make sure servers are running: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000/auth/register`
3. Fill out the registration form
4. Check browser console for debug output
5. Registration should now work and redirect to dashboard

## API Format
The new endpoints expect simple JSON:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "tenantName": "My Organization"
}
```

## Next Steps
- Test the registration flow end-to-end
- If working, we can later migrate back to proper tRPC client usage
- The tRPC endpoints remain available for other operations

## Status
âœ… Server endpoints created
âœ… Client updated to use new endpoints
