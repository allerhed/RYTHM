# GitHub Actions Workflows - DISABLED ✅

## 🚫 Disabled Workflows

### 1. Deploy Applications Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-applications.yml`
**Status**: ✅ DISABLED

**What was disabled**:
- ❌ **Automatic deployment on push to main branch**
- ❌ **Auto-trigger on file changes**
- ✅ Manual trigger still available (but with safety check)

**Changes made**:
- Commented out `push` trigger
- Added `if: false` safety condition
- Updated workflow name to indicate disabled status
- Manual `workflow_dispatch` still available but requires manual override

### 2. Backup Strategy Workflow  
**File**: `.github/workflows/backup-strategy.yml`
**Status**: ✅ DISABLED

**What was disabled**:
- ❌ **Daily automatic backups at 2 AM UTC**
- ❌ **Scheduled cron job**
- ✅ Manual backup trigger still available (but with safety check)

**Changes made**:
- Commented out `schedule` trigger
- Added `if: false` safety condition
- Updated workflow name to indicate disabled status
- Manual `workflow_dispatch` still available but requires manual override

### 3. Deploy Infrastructure Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-infrastructure.yml`
**Status**: ✅ ALREADY MANUAL-ONLY

**No changes needed**:
- Already manual-only (`workflow_dispatch` only)
- Requires explicit confirmation input
- No automatic triggers

## 🔒 Safety Features

### Double Protection
Each disabled workflow has **two layers of protection**:

1. **Trigger Level**: No automatic triggers (push/schedule commented out)
2. **Job Level**: `if: false` condition prevents execution even if manually triggered

### Manual Override Available
If you need to run a workflow manually:
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select the workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. **Note**: You'll need to edit the workflow file first to remove `if: false`

## ♻️ How to Re-enable

### For Deploy Applications Workflow
```yaml
# In .github/workflows/deploy-applications.yml

# 1. Uncomment the push trigger:
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths-ignore:
      - 'infra/**'
      - 'docs/**'
      - '**.md'
  workflow_dispatch:
    # ... rest of config

# 2. Remove the safety condition:
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: prod
    # Remove this line: if: false
```

### For Backup Strategy Workflow
```yaml
# In .github/workflows/backup-strategy.yml

# 1. Uncomment the schedule trigger:
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:
    # ... rest of config

# 2. Remove the safety condition:
jobs:
  backup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: prod
    # Remove this line: if: false
```

## 📋 Current State

| **Workflow** | **Automatic Triggers** | **Manual Trigger** | **Safety Check** |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Deploy Applications** | ❌ Disabled | ⚠️ Available (blocked) | ✅ `if: false` |
| **Backup Strategy** | ❌ Disabled | ⚠️ Available (blocked) | ✅ `if: false` |
| **Deploy Infrastructure** | ❌ None (by design) | ✅ Available | ⚠️ Confirmation required |

## 🎯 Benefits

### No Accidental Deployments
- Push to main won't trigger deployments
- No overnight backup jobs running
- Manual control over all infrastructure changes

### Easy Re-activation
- Workflows preserved with clear instructions
- Quick uncomment to re-enable
- All functionality intact

### Development Freedom
- Push changes without triggering builds
- Test fixes without deployment risk
- Direct ACR builds still available for testing

## 📝 Summary

✅ **All automatic GitHub Actions deployments are now DISABLED**
✅ **Backup jobs are disabled** 
✅ **Manual triggers available but safely blocked**
✅ **Easy to re-enable when ready**

You can now push changes to the main branch without triggering any automatic deployments. Your direct ACR build scripts (`./scripts/build-*-direct.sh`) are still available for manual testing and deployment.
