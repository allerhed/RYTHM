## 🚧 **TODO - Remaining from PRD**

### 1. **Analytics & Insights** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- ❌ **Training volume calculations**: Σ(weight_kg × reps) by time period
- ❌ **Muscle split analytics**: Volume/sets distribution by muscle group  
- ❌ **Pace calculations**: distance_m / duration_s for cardio sessions
- ❌ **1RM estimations**: Epley/Brzycki formulas for strength exercises
- ❌ **PR tracking**: Personal records and progression notifications
- ❌ **Trend charts**: Visual progress over time
- ❌ **Filtering**: By session category, date range, muscle group
- ❌ **Materialized views**: For performance optimization

### 2. **Program Management** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- ❌ **Program builder**: Week/day/exercise structure
- ❌ **Program assignments**: Assign programs to athletes/teams
- ❌ **Program templates**: Reusable program structures
- ❌ **Workout scheduling**: Calendar integration
- ❌ **Adherence tracking**: Completion rates and compliance
- ❌ **Auto-progression**: Automatic weight/intensity adjustments

### 3. **Enhanced UX/UI** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- ❌ **Quick-add functionality**: Last weight/reps shortcuts
- ❌ **Swipe gestures**: Intuitive set completion
- ❌ **Voice input**: Hands-free logging
- ❌ **Offline sync**: Service Worker implementation
- ❌ **Background sync**: Queue failed requests
- ❌ **Progressive Web App**: Full PWA features
- ❌ **Conflict resolution**: Offline/online data merging

### 4. **Admin Interface** (LOW PRIORITY)
- ❌ **Web admin dashboard**: Separate admin interface
- ❌ **Tenant management**: Branding, domains, settings
- ❌ **User management**: Bulk operations, role assignments
- ❌ **Exercise library CRUD**: Admin exercise management
- ❌ **Audit logging**: Change tracking and compliance
- ❌ **Analytics overview**: Tenant-wide insights

### 5. **Advanced Features** (FUTURE)
- ❌ **Social features**: Feed, compare, share workouts
- ❌ **Team functionality**: Coach/athlete relationships
- ❌ **Export capabilities**: CSV/PDF reports
- ❌ **Integration APIs**: Third-party fitness devices
- ❌ **Advanced analytics**: ML-powered insights
- ❌ **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
