# Backup History & Status Implementation

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## Problem
The admin UI for backups didn't show whether the nightly backup had run, and there was no visibility into the backup history or status. Users couldn't see if scheduled backups were working properly.

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive backup history system with the following components:

### 1. Database Schema (`009_backup_history.sql`)
Created `backup_history` table to track all backup operations:

```sql
- history_id: UUID primary key
- backup_filename: Name of backup file in blob storage
- backup_type: 'scheduled' or 'manual'
- status: 'started', 'completed', or 'failed'
- file_size_bytes: Size of backup file
- duration_seconds: How long backup took
- error_message: Error details if failed
- initiated_by_user_id: User who triggered manual backup
- started_at: When backup started
- completed_at: When backup finished
```

### 2. Backend Updates

#### BackupService (`apps/api/src/services/backup.service.ts`)
- Updated `createBackup()` to accept `{ userId?, type? }` options
- Logs backup start to `backup_history` table
- Updates history on completion with file size and duration
- Updates history on failure with error message
- Maintains transaction consistency

#### BackupScheduler (`apps/api/src/services/BackupScheduler.ts`)
- Passes `type: 'scheduled'` when creating automated backups
- Ensures scheduled backups are properly tracked

#### Backup Routes (`apps/api/src/routes/backups.ts`)
- Updated POST `/api/backups` to pass `userId` and `type: 'manual'`
- Enhanced GET `/api/backups` to merge blob storage data with history
- Returns enriched backup data including:
  - `type`: scheduled/manual/unknown
  - `status`: started/completed/failed
  - `duration_seconds`: backup duration
  - `initiated_by`: email of user who triggered manual backup

### 3. Admin UI Updates (`apps/admin/src/app/backups/page.tsx`)

#### Enhanced Backup Interface
Updated `Backup` interface to include:
```typescript
interface Backup {
  name: string
  size: number
  createdAt: string
  url: string
  type?: 'manual' | 'scheduled' | 'unknown'
  status?: 'started' | 'completed' | 'failed'
  duration_seconds?: number
  initiated_by?: string
}
```

#### Prominent Status Display
Added visual indicator showing if today's automated backup has run:
- ‚úÖ **Green banner** if backup completed today
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow banner** if no backup today
- Shows last backup timestamp

#### Enhanced Backup Table
Added new columns to backup list:
1. **Type**: Visual badge showing if backup was scheduled (üïê) or manual (üë§)
2. **Duration**: How long the backup took in seconds
3. **Initiated By**: Email of user who triggered manual backup (or "System" for scheduled)

#### Helper Functions
- `isBackupToday(dateString)`: Checks if backup ran today (UTC comparison)
- Proper formatting for backup types with color-coded badges

## Deployment

### Migration
```bash
# Applied to production database
psql -h psql-tvqklipuckq3a.postgres.database.azure.com \
     -U rythm_admin -d rythm \
     -f packages/db/migrations/009_backup_history.sql
```

### Container Updates
```bash
# Built and deployed updated containers
az acr build --registry crtvqklipuckq3a --image rythm-api:latest ...
az acr build --registry crtvqklipuckq3a --image rythm-admin:latest ...
az containerapp update --name ca-api-tvqklipuckq3a ...
az containerapp update --name ca-admin-tvqklipuckq3a ...
```

## Features

### For Administrators
1. **Visibility**: Clear indication if today's automated backup completed
2. **History**: Full audit trail of all backups (manual and scheduled)
3. **Accountability**: See who initiated manual backups
4. **Performance**: Track backup duration and file sizes
5. **Reliability**: Monitor backup success/failure status

### For System Operations
1. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of backup operations
2. **Troubleshooting**: Error messages logged for failed backups
3. **Analytics**: Track backup sizes and durations over time
4. **Compliance**: Historical record of backup operations

## Verification

### Check Current Status
```bash
# View backup schedule and last run
psql -c "SELECT enabled, schedule_time, last_run_at, next_run_at FROM backup_schedule;"

# View backup history
psql -c "SELECT backup_filename, backup_type, status, duration_seconds, 
         started_at FROM backup_history ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

### Expected Behavior
1. **Scheduled Backup**: Runs daily at 02:00 UTC
2. **Last Run**: Shows in both `backup_schedule.last_run_at` and admin UI
3. **Today's Status**: Green banner if backup completed today
4. **Backup List**: Shows all backups with type badges and metadata

## Production Status

### Current Configuration
- **Schedule Time**: 02:00 UTC (2 AM)
- **Retention**: 30 days
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Enabled
- **Last Run**: October 5, 2025 at 02:00 UTC
- **Next Run**: October 6, 2025 at 02:00 UTC

### Today's Backup
- **Filename**: `rythm-backup-2025-10-05T02-00-00-595Z.sql`
- **Size**: 168.47 KB
- **Duration**: <1 second
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
- **Type**: Scheduled
- **Notification**: ‚úÖ Sent to system admins

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Restore History**: Track database restores in a similar table
2. **Backup Validation**: Verify backup integrity after creation
3. **Size Trends**: Chart showing backup size growth over time
4. **Performance Alerts**: Notify if backup takes longer than usual
5. **Failed Backup Retry**: Automatically retry failed scheduled backups
6. **Backup Testing**: Scheduled restore tests to verify backups work

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. Set up alerts if backup fails
2. Monitor backup duration trends
3. Track backup size growth
4. Verify scheduled backups run daily
5. Test restore procedures periodically

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `/packages/db/migrations/009_backup_history.sql` - Database schema

### Modified Files
- `/apps/api/src/services/backup.service.ts` - History logging
- `/apps/api/src/services/BackupScheduler.ts` - Scheduled backup tracking
- `/apps/api/src/routes/backups.ts` - API endpoint enhancements
- `/apps/admin/src/app/backups/page.tsx` - UI improvements

## Testing

### Manual Test Procedure
1. Navigate to admin UI `/backups` page
2. Verify today's backup status shows green ‚úÖ
3. Check backup list shows type badges
4. Create manual backup and verify it logs correctly
5. Verify "Initiated By" shows your email for manual backup

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check today's scheduled backup is logged
SELECT * FROM backup_history 
WHERE backup_type = 'scheduled' 
  AND DATE(started_at) = CURRENT_DATE;

-- Verify manual backups log user
SELECT bh.*, u.email 
FROM backup_history bh
LEFT JOIN users u ON bh.initiated_by_user_id = u.user_id
WHERE backup_type = 'manual';
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, can rollback by:
1. Revert container apps to previous revision
2. Keep database table (doesn't break anything)
3. Remove history logging from code if needed

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

- [x] Backup history table created in production
- [x] API logs all backup operations to history
- [x] Admin UI shows prominent "backup ran today" indicator
- [x] Backup list displays type, duration, and initiator
- [x] Scheduled backups tracked with type='scheduled'
- [x] Manual backups tracked with user_id and type='manual'
- [x] Today's scheduled backup visible in admin UI
- [x] Error handling maintains data integrity
- [x] Deployed to production successfully

## Notes

- History table uses UUID primary key for future-proof extensibility
- Indexes added for common query patterns (status, started_at, type)
- NULL user_id for scheduled backups (system-initiated)
- UTC timestamps used throughout for consistency
- Backup file names still in blob storage are source of truth
- History provides metadata and audit trail
